      <article class="description" data-img="FRC.jpg"> I’ve been part of FRC Team 9262 for the past two years, and it’s been one of the most
	  exciting and rewarding parts of my high school journey. As Finance Lead, I helped secure over $20,000 in sponsorships through outreach
	  and partnerships, which played a huge role in supporting our season. Beyond the business side, I stayed involved with strategy and 
	  build, contributing to our overall team performance. We made it to provincials twice, and I was proud to be recognized as a Dean’s List 
	  Award semifinalist for my leadership and impact both on and off the field. Looking forward to the 2026 FRC Season! </article>

	 <article class="description" data-img="STEM.jpg">STEM has always been a huge part of my life, and I’ve made it a mission to share that 
	 passion with others. I’ve led and run hands-on experiments, brought in guest speakers from various STEM fields, and organized workshops
	 aimed at making science and technology fun and accessible. One of the highlights has been running STEM workshops for elementary school 
	 students—creating engaging, age-appropriate activities that spark curiosity and encourage early interest in STEM. </article>
	 
      <h3 class="extra-title">DECA – Co Vice President</h3>
	   <br>
	  <article class="description" data-img="DECA.jpg">Through DECA, I’ve been able to explore my interest in business and finance in a 
	  hands-on, competitive environment. I competed in the Personal Finance category, where I developed real-world skills in budgeting, 
	  saving, and financial decision-making. After months of preparation and practice, I placed top 10 regionally, which was a rewarding
	  reflection of the hard work I put in. DECA has helped me grow my confidence, sharpen my presentation skills, and deepen my understanding

	  experiences, I’ve strengthened my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, while learning how to collaborate under pressure in 
	  team-based settings. Preparing for and competing in these contests has taught me how to stay focused, think creatively, and tackle

  <div class="modal" id="modal-p1"><div class="modal-content"><span class="modal-close">&times;</span><h3>Operations Intern @ JYI</h3><p> During my internship at the Journal of Young Investigators, I focused on strengthening the organization's internal operations and communications. I created a comprehensive onboarding package to help new interns integrate smoothly, managed the monthly newsletter to keep the team informed and connected, and supported updates to the staff list to reflect our evolving team structure. I contributed to content planning and also provided insight into how a revamped communication system could reduce delays in volunteer response time and increase motivation by making expectations clearer and engagement more consistent. These tasks, though often behind the scenes, played a crucial role in building cohesion, improving workflow, and enhancing the overall intern experience at JYI. </p></div></div>
  <div class="modal" id="modal-p2"><div class="modal-content"><span class="modal-close">&times;</span><h3>VP Tech @ JA</h3><p>I served as the Vice President of Technology for our Junior Achievement student company, Threadlings, where I led the tech department in developing our online presence and streamlining operations. I created and managed our company website, designed and maintained social media platforms, and integrated essential tech tools like Square for payments and Mailchimp for email marketing. Thanks to these efforts, we surpassed $1,000 in revenue and sold over 120 units. Beyond just the technical work, I helped improve our marketing and sales strategies through technology, which contributed significantly to our success. For my contributions, I was honored to receive the JA Central Ontario Leadership in Technology Award.</p></div></div>
  <div class="modal" id="modal-p3"><div class="modal-content"><span class="modal-close">&times;</span><h3>Fellow @ SHAD</h3><p>I had the incredible opportunity to attend the 2024 Shad Canada program at Ontario Tech University. Over the course of a month, I collaborated with bright, driven students from across the country on a real-world challenge—and our team ended up winning first place in the Design and Entrepreneurial Project. Our startup, ChillCharge, focused on reducing fossil fuel consumption in northern regions of Canada, specifically Nunavut. We designed a waste heat capturing system that transports residual heat from power plants into a greenhouse containing nearly 6,000 thermoelectric generators. By leveraging the extreme temperature difference—waste heat inside and freezing temperatures outside—we were able to generate enough electricity to power 1,000 homes. It was an ambitious, bold idea that pushed the boundaries of sustainable energy</p></div></div>
